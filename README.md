# Vending-Machine
Developed a Verilog-based vending machine controller using a finite state machine (FSM) to simulate real-world coin-based transactions. The system accepts ₹5 and ₹10 inputs, manages internal states to track total value, dispenses an item upon reaching ₹15, and returns appropriate change. Designed for clarity, correctness, and reliable sequential logic behavior under synchronous clocking.
